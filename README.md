# Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains a collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects on various datasets. Each project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the provided datasets to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis is an essential step in the data analysis process. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset, examining its structure, and visualizing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies. The projects in this repository demonstrate the application of EDA techniques on different datasets, showcasing how data can be explored and interpreted effectively.
